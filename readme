PKGUTIL
=======

Pkgutil, written in Perl and licensed under GPL, is a tool to make
installation of packages in Solaris easier. It handles package
dependencies so all required packages are installed before the desired
package automatically.

Configure
---------

There's a configuration file in /opt/csw/etc/pkgutil.conf. The only thing
you normally need to change there is the mirror location. If you have a
pkgutil.conf file in /etc/opt/csw it will override the one in /opt/csw/etc
on a setting-by-setting basis. If no pkgutil.conf is found in either of
those two locations defaults are used.

    it will fetch all packages necessary regardless of their location
