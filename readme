PKGUTIL
=======

Pkgutil, written in Perl and licensed under GPL, is a tool to make
installation of packages in Solaris easier. It handles package
dependencies so all required packages are installed before the desired
package automatically.

Configure
---------

There's a configuration file in /opt/csw/etc/pkgutil.conf. The only thing
you normally need to change there is the mirror location. If you have a
pkgutil.conf file in /etc/opt/csw it will override the one in /opt/csw/etc
on a setting-by-setting basis. If no pkgutil.conf is found in either of
those two locations defaults are used.

Version history
---------------

* v1.8. Released 2009-10-30
  - Fix transform feature (3904@OpenCSW)
  - Support I-dependencies
  - Split package into core pkgutil and extension pkgutilplus

  - bldcat and chkcat doesn't require CSWperl, exit with helpful message if
    Digest::MD5 is missing (3917@OpenCSW)
  - Catalog update interval user configurable via pkgutil.conf. Set to -1
    for no automatic updates, 0 for every time pkgutil is run and 1+ for
    the number of days between updates. 14 would emulate current behavior
    (Trygve Laugstol)

* v1.2.1. Released 2008-11-28
  - Fixes compare bug with package names containing dashes

* v1.2. Released 2008-11-12
  - Temp site (-t) does no longer replace the mirror defined in pkgutil.conf. 
    It instead is considered the primary location and the mirror defined in 
    pkgutil.conf is considered the secondary. That means you can point -t to 
    your own repository of packages that are built with dependencies to CSW and 
    it will fetch all packages necessary regardless of their location
  - Better MD5 support for Solaris 8 and 9
  - Arguments to -a and -c are now treated like filters so 
    "pkgutil -a bind dhcp" equals "pkgutil -a | egrep -i 'bind|dhcp'"
  - Changed version info to be -v instead of -V
  - Added -V (syscheck) to show info about binaries and more that pkgutil
    needs to support all features

  - bundled wget binaries moved to /opt/csw/libexec/pkgutil

    files if they are located in the same directory as the catalog parsed
