# Nothing below is mandatory to change, pkgutil will use the default values 
# noted below for each option unless something is uncommented

# Mirror to use for downloads
# See http://www.opencsw.org/mirrors for alternative mirrors
# Default: http://ibiblio.org/pub/packages/solaris/opencsw/current

# Solaris 10: If you wish to limit pkgutil to installing packages
# only to the global zone, then uncomment this line. Note that pkgrm does not
# have the same option
# WARNING: do not modify this unless you know what you're doing
# Default: blank
#pkgaddopts=-G

# Flags for use with wget, e.g. "-nv" for less verbose or "-q" for quiet
# WARNING: do not modify this unless you know what you're doing
# Default: blank
#wgetopts=-q

# To enable use of gpg or md5, uncomment these
# NOTE: it doesn't make sense to use md5 but not gpg so your options should be:
#       1. both disabled, 2. gpg enabled, 3. both enabled.
# Default: false, false
#use_gpg=true
#use_md5=true
